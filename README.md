# emma-s-computing-repository
This repository was created for the GNSC 3301 course. Before creating this repository, I did not know what a repository was or how to create one. Through the lecture in class and this assignment, I now know how to create and use a GitHub repository. This skill will be useful for me to have during this course and as we work on our project!
